## What is Band-Aide?
Band-Aide makes being in or managing a DIY band easier.  Itâ€™s meant to be useful and fun.  

Band-Aide is built on top of open-source technologies by musicians, for musicians. 

If we build Band-Aide, they will come. If they need a feature, they can help build it. They being us. We being everyone.
